Welcome to the Blade OS Beta! We're excited to show you the development process of Blade OS & where it's at.

{{< tip "warning" >}} Blade OS is a work in progress operating system, which means it's not fully complete yet. It's not recommended to install it on any production machines you have. It is highly recommended to install on a secondary or virtual machine. If you run into any problems, please create an [issue](https://github.com/Blade-OS/os/issues/new/choose "Open an issue") on our GitHub page. {{< /tip >}}

## Download the ISO
ISO's can be found in our GitHub actions. Direct downloads will be coming soon.
