# Welcome to Blade OS!

## A brand new distro based on Debian that has everything pre-configured.

{{< tip "warning" >}} Blade OS is a work in progress operating system, which means it's not fully complete yet. Try at your own risk. {{< /tip >}}

{{< tip >}} The distro will come with GNOME by default. However, there will be XFCE & KDE options available at a later date. {{< /tip >}}

## If you want to try out the latest build, download it below.
