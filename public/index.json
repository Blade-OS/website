If you installed Blade OS using a different filesystem, RSYNC will be your only option. In this guide, we\u0026rsquo;ll be using the btrfs type. Things may vary on snapshot type.\nSnapshot Location You can change the location on where snapshots are stored here. Automatic Backups You can change the behavior of automatic backups here.\nIt is highly recommended that you have at least one way of automatic backup in case your system breaks. Directory Setup You can include user home directories in backups if wanted. For rsync backups, you can include or exclude specific files \u0026amp; directories.\nYou can re-configure these by going into the app settings or clicking Wizzard in the main menu at anytime. Using Timeshift Using Timeshift is straightforward. You can create a snapshot at anytime by pressing the Create button. You can add a comment by clicking on it\u0026rsquo;s section. To restore a snapshot, Select a snapshot and click Restore. Note that restoring a snapshot may take awhile. After the snapshot is restored, restart your system to apply changes. You can also browse the snapshot files by clicking on Browse. Restoring from a Live System In the case of your system being broken, You can restore a snapshot through a live medium of Blade OS or another Linux distribution. Open the Timeshift app on the live system. You may have to manually install it depending on the distribution your currently using. Make sure all the settings are correct, then select a snapshot to restore. Press the Restore button to start the process. Timeshift running in Live Mode on a pre-release version of Blade OS.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s how to use Timeshift.
